# GeospaCy


**GeospaCy** is a web application built in Python language used for extracting spatial relation entities (spatRE) from text and geo-referencing them. 

## Installation
There are few Python packages that are needed to install for running the application.

1. Install spacy for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
```sh
pip install spacy
```
2. Install gensim library for data preprocessing.
```sh
pip install gensim
```
3. Install streamit library for running web application. 
```sh
pip install streamlit
```
4. Install spacy-streamlit for display named entities (spatRE) in the text.
```sh
pip install spacy-streamlit
```

5. Install GeoPandas
```sh
pip install geopandas
```
6.  Install folium library for manipulating your data in Python, then visualize it in a Leaflet map via folium.

```sh
pip install folium
```
7. Install streamlit-folium library to visualize Leaflet map in streamlit web application.

```sh
pip install streamlit-folium
```
8. Download spacy's en_core_web_md.
```sh
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

## How to run the web application

```sh
streamlit run 1_üè†_Parser.py
```
